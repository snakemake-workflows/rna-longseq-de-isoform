 Heatmap of normalized gene expression data across all samples, highlighting pattern expression levels.
 The heatmap is generated using Seaborn's clustermap function which organizes data by performing hierarchical clustering on the gene row and sample columns based on their expression profiles.
 This clustering groups together genes and samples with similar expression patterns, making it easier to identify clusters of co-expressed genes and similar samples.
 The color intensity represents the level of gene expression.

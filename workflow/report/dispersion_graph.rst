 Assuming that genes with similar average expression strength will have a similar degree of dispersion, pyDESeq2 calculates the gene-wise dispersion estimates for each separate gene (black dots).
 The distribution of these estimates is then used to determine the location parameter (red curve), for an accurate estimation of expected dispersion values for a gene given its expression strength.
 The gene-wise dispersion estimates are then shrunk towards the value predicted by the curve to obtain their final dispersion values (blue dots).
 The degree of shrinkage depends on estimating the proximity of true dispersion to the fit and the degrees of freedom because with increasing sample size the shrinkage decreases.

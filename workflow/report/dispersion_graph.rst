 The dispersion plot is employed to assess the quality of the initial sequencing data, on the assumption that genes with analogous average expression strength will exhibit a comparable degree of dispersion.
 The dispersion is initially estimated for each gene (black dots) and the idealized location paramter (red curve) is used to calculate the final dispersion values (blue dots). 
 In an optimal scenario, the final dispersion values should scatter in close proximity to the location parameter.

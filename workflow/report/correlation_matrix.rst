 The correlation matrix is computed by calculating the pairwise Pearson correlations between genes across all samples.
 The matrix is then used to create a heatmap that visualizes the strength of correlation, with hierarchical clustering applied to group samples with similar expression patterns into dendograms.
 This can be used to identify clusters of samples that share similar gene expression patterns, which might suggest shared regulatory mechanisms or functional pathways.

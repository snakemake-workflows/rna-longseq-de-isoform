## General Workflow Parameters:

# Name of the Workflow:
workflow: "workflow-transcriptome-de_phe"

# this is the input directory. All samples are looked for in this directory
inputdir: "/lustre/project/nhr-zdvhpc/transcriptome_data"
# Repository URL:
repo: "https://github.com/snakemake-workflows/transriptome-differential-expression"

## Workflow-specific Parameters:

# The reference genome respectively transcriptome, is defined here:
# You can provide either 'genome' or 'annotation' reference files locally.
# If both 'genome' and 'annotation' are available no 'accession' number is needed.
# In any other case an 'accession' number is needed to download missing reference data remotely.
ref:
    species: "Chironomus riparius"

    # Local reference data
    # Genome file path; can be left empty if remote download is prefered.
    # allowed extensions: ".fa" or ".fna" or ".fasta"
    genome: ""
    #genome: "/lustre/project/nhr-zdvhpc/transcriptome_data/GCA_917627325.4_PGI_CHIRRI_v4_genomic.fa"
    # Annotation file (supported extensions: .gff, .gtf, case-insensitive)
    #                 may be a path or left empty, if download using an accession number is preferred
    annotation: ""

# Differential Isoform Analysis

# The differential isoform analysis pipeline uses FLAIR and includes resource-intensive computations and only works with additional constraints.
#     1. In 'samples.csv: The 'condition' column must contain exactly two distinct values. For example 'control' and 'treated'.
#     2. In 'samples.csv: Refrain from using underscores when naming samples. The 'sample' column may contain underscores, but be aware that underscores will be removed from the name for isoform quantification steps.
#     3. In this file: the variable 'isoform_analysis' below must be:'"yes"'. This is a check to determine if users are aware of the constraints and wish to proceed.

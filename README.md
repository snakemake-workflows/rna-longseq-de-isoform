This workflow performs differential gene expression and isoform splicing analysis on Nanopore long read RNA-Seq data using minimap2, salmon and pyDeseq2. Isoform detection, quantification and differential expression analysis is integrated via FLAIR. We plan to incorporate auto-annotation when ontological data is missing.
